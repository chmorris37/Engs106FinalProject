UnderstandingData.md gives quick overview of the data

accessData.ipynb shows how to create a Pandas df of everything we need

creatingFeatures.ipynb gives deeper understanding of the data, shows baseline prediction for us to beat, and creates relevent features for our project to use

catBoost.ipynb is an ML model trying to beat the baseline score (MAE)

deepLearning.ipynb is a DL model (1D CNN) trying to beat the baseline score (MAE)

linear_regression_henry.ipynb is Linear regression models with the created features that fail to beat the baseline score (MAE); end of this document does include chart summary of MAE Values across all models
